Keystate — Development & Testing Workflow

This document describes how work moves through the Keystate repos, day to day. It applies to every repo in the organization unless a repo's own README says otherwise.

1. Branching Model

Two protected branches, and everything between them flows through pull requests:

- **`develop` — integration branch, where all work lands.** Feature and fix
  branches are created off `develop`, and merged back into `develop` via PR
  (at least one review required). Short-lived: created off develop, merged
  back in, deleted. All quality gates in `ci.yml` run here — on every push to
  `develop` and on every PR.
- **`main` — release-only.** Nothing is pushed to `main` directly and feature
  work never merges there. The *only* way `main` changes is a release PR from
  `develop`, which is exactly what's merged when a release is wanted. Merging
  it triggers `release.yml`, which gates the release and publishes.

Releases are a deliberate act, not an ambient side effect of merging work:
- a PR targets `main` only when it's meant to ship;
- `develop` keeps accumulating ordinary work without ever touching `main`;
- this mirrors the five-repo flow in the release document, where adapters and
  the CLI pin tagged core versions rather than publishing every core change.

Branch naming: feat/<short-description>, fix/<short-description>, chore/<short-description>. Keep it short enough to read in a PR list.

Commit convention: Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, chore:, test:, docs:). This isn't bureaucracy for its own sake — it's what drives automated changelog generation and semver bumps in the release process (see the companion release document), so it needs to be consistent from the first commit.

2. The Standard Feature Flow

Because the domain model lives in keystate-core and adapters depend on it, most non-trivial features touch more than one repo, in a fixed order. Take "add support for extracting client scope mappers" as a worked example:

Step 1 — Does this change the canonical model?

Ask this first, always — but expect the answer to be "no" most of the time. Since canonical structs carry only a thin set of common fields plus an open native: serde_json::Value, the large majority of feature work is "extract this field Keycloak already has and put it in native, and add its path to the manifest" — entirely within the adapter repo, no core release required. That's intentional: it's what keeps adapter velocity decoupled from core's release cadence.

A core change is only needed for one of these:

A field is a genuine promotion candidate — it now appears in native for two or more backends and belongs in common for cross-backend comparison to work. Promotions are additive minor bumps in core, and get a changelog entry naming the fields and backends that justified the move. They also carry a release-train obligation: all live adapters must absorb the new common field before any CLI tags a combination including it, or verification will read healthy realms as "incomplete" due to version skew (see RELEASE.md §1).
A new envelope-level concept, not an entity-level one — e.g. the envelope needs to carry something new about backend_info itself.
A new cross-cutting mechanism — e.g. the volatile flag or the canonical-writer contract being introduced or changed, which every adapter needs to honor.

If none of those apply, skip straight to Step 3 and stay entirely in the adapter repo.

Step 2 — keystate-core
Branch off develop.
Extend the canonical model (e.g. add a ClientScopeMapper struct, or a field on an existing struct). Keep new fields additive where possible — adding a field is a minor version bump; changing or removing one is a major bump and breaks every adapter that hasn't been updated yet.
Update the contract test suite so any Extractor implementation is now required to populate the new field, if it's meant to be mandatory.
Update the FieldManifest / completeness-verification data so the new field is something the verifier actually checks for, not just a struct sitting unused.
Open a PR to develop. Once a group of changes is ready to ship, open the release PR from develop to main; merging it publishes per the release document. Nothing downstream should start consuming the new core version until it's actually tagged and published — don't build against a branch.
Step 3 — Adapter (e.g. keystate-adapter-keycloak)
Bump the keystate-core dependency in Cargo.toml to the new tagged version.
Implement the actual extraction logic: the query against Keycloak's schema, the mapping into the new canonical struct.
Add an integration test against a real Keycloak instance (via testcontainers, see Section 4) that proves the new field is actually populated correctly, not just that the code compiles.
Add a determinism test if the new data introduces any new ordering concerns (see Section 4.4).
Open a PR to develop. Releases happen via the release PR from develop to main.
Step 4 — keystate-cli
Bump both keystate-core and the adapter dependency to their new tagged versions.
Run the full local test suite and the compatibility matrix check.
Update the CLI's own compatibility matrix entry if this changes which backend versions are supported.
Open a PR to develop. When the combination is ready, merge the release PR to main — this is the artifact that actually ships to users, so it's the one release that triggers a Docker image build and publish.

The rule of thumb: core → adapter → cli, always in that order, never skipped. An adapter should never depend on an unreleased core commit, and the CLI should never depend on an unreleased adapter commit. This keeps each repo's history independently buildable and independently auditable — which matters for a tool people are trusting with database credentials.

Step 5 — Adapter-only features

Most day-to-day work will actually just be Step 3 and 4 — most features are "extract this field Keycloak already has that we haven't mapped yet," not new canonical concepts. Same discipline applies, just starting one level in.

3. Local Development Setup

Since the repos are genuinely separate (not a Cargo workspace), local cross-repo iteration uses Cargo's [patch] mechanism rather than publishing a new core version for every experiment:

toml
# In keystate-adapter-keycloak/Cargo.toml, while developing locally
[patch."https://github.com/keystate/keystate-core"]
keystate-core = { path = "../keystate-core" }

Remove the patch before opening a PR — CI should always build against published versions, not local paths, so what's tested is what will actually be released.

For exercising adapters against a real backend, each adapter repo should ship a docker-compose.yml that spins up the target backend (Keycloak + Postgres, or FerrisKey + Postgres) pre-seeded with a representative realm — this is what both local development and CI integration tests run against.

4. Testing Strategy

Four layers, each catching a different class of problem:

4.1 Unit tests (every repo)

Standard cargo test coverage of pure logic — canonical model serialization, mapping functions, the completeness-verification engine itself. No database involved. Run on every commit, every PR, fast.

4.2 Contract tests (keystate-core, run by every adapter)

keystate-core ships a reusable test suite that any Extractor implementation must pass — this is what actually enforces the port contract beyond the type signature. Every adapter repo imports and runs this suite against its own implementation as part of CI.

The suite covers: canonical serialization determinism (serialize twice, assert byte-identical, roundtrip), volatile segregation (every manifest-volatile path lands in the volatile section and nowhere else), manifest self-consistency, and synthetic-case verifier checks (empty realm, zero-row entities, missing required fields, misplaced volatile fields). See ARCHITECTURE.md §7.

4.3 Integration tests (adapter repos)

Real backend, real database, via testcontainers. These run against a matrix of supported backend versions (e.g. the last 3–4 Keycloak minor versions) so a schema change in a specific version is caught in CI, not reported by a user. These are slower — run on every PR to the adapter repo, and on a schedule (nightly) against main to catch drift from upstream backend releases even when no PR is open (see the release document's upstream-tracking section).

4.4 Determinism / idempotency tests (adapter and CLI repos)

Run extraction twice against an unchanged fixture database, hash both outputs, assert the hashes match. This is a direct, automated check on the idempotency property from the architecture document — any PR that breaks it should fail CI, not get caught in manual review.

4.5 Completeness regression tests (adapter repos, scheduled)

Periodically extract from a throwaway Keycloak instance via Keystate, and separately via Keycloak's own official CLI export (the stop-server one), then diff the two. This is the strongest available check that the DB-based extraction isn't silently missing something the official tooling captures — run it on a schedule rather than every PR, since it requires stopping a test server.

5. What CI Runs, and When

CI lives in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (checks) and
`.github/workflows/release.yml` (release-plz automation).

| Trigger | Checks |
|---|---|
| Every PR (to develop or main) and every push to develop | cargo fmt --check, cargo clippy -- -D warnings, unit + doc tests, MSRV check (1.85), cargo audit, cargo deny |
| PR to main (the release PR) | Quality gate: fmt, clippy, tests, cargo package |
| Release PR merged into main | release-plz creates the git tag (keystate-core-v<version>), publishes to crates.io, and creates the GitHub release |
| Nightly, scheduled | Full backend version matrix (integration tests across all supported versions), completeness regression test (adapter repos) |

Nothing ships without a green gate: the release-plz job only runs on the main
merge, and the crates.io token exists only as the CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN secret.

6. Code Review Checklist

Beyond the usual correctness review, reviewers on Keystate PRs specifically check:

Does this preserve determinism? Any new collection must be sorted by a stable key before serialization; any new map must use BTreeMap, not HashMap, if key order could otherwise vary.
Is this canonical-model change additive or breaking? Breaking changes need a clear justification and a major version bump — they're not free.
Is the completeness manifest updated alongside any new field? A field that exists in the model but isn't tracked by the verifier is a silent gap in exactly the property (completeness) this tool exists to guarantee.
Does any new output path keep the trust boundary intact? Data never transits Keystate-operated infrastructure; a new sink is a new OutputSink implementation running in the user's own environment, never a Keystate-owned endpoint (ARCHITECTURE.md §3.4).
Are secrets or credential data ever logged, printed, or included in error messages? Given what this tool touches, this is a hard no in every review, not a style preference.
